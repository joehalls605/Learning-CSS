/*
CSS variables (also known as custom properties) are a way to store values in CSS that you can reuse throughout your stylesheet. This makes it easier to maintain and update styles consistently.

Define CSS variable by using -- followed by the name of the variable. Itâ€™s typically placed inside a selector, like :root (which targets the whole document), so the variable is accessible globally.
