/*
Static Positioning
Static positioning is the default position for HTML elements.
Elements are positioned according to the normal flow of the page.
The top, bottom, left, and right properties have no effect.
*/

div.static {
  position: static;
}

/*
Relative Positioning
Positioned relative to its normal position.
It means that the element’s position is adjusted based on its original position in the normal flow of the document.
Adjusted using top, right, bottom, and left properties.
Other content doesn’t adjust to fill gaps left by the element.
*/

div.relative {
  position: relative;
  left: 30px; /* Moves 30px to the right of its original position */
}

/*
Fixed Positioning
Positioned relative to the viewport (stays in the same place even when scrolled).
Use top, right, bottom, and left properties.
Doesn’t leave a gap in the page.
Commonly used for headers, footers, or sidebars that should remain visible during scrolling.
*/

div.fixed {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0; /* Sticks to the bottom-right corner of the viewport */
}

/*
Absolute Positioning
Positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (or the initial containing block if none).
Removed from the normal flow, can overlap other elements.
Doesn’t leave a gap in the page.
Adjusted using top, right, bottom, and left properties.
*/

div.absolute {
  position: absolute;
  top: 80px;
  right: 0; /* Positioned 80px down from the top and flush to the right of its containing block */
}

/*
Sticky Positioning
Based on user’s scroll position.
Toggles between relative and fixed.
“Sticks” in place after a certain offset.
Adjusted using top, right, bottom, and left properties.
*/

div.sticky {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0; /* Sticks the element to the top of its container when scrolling */
