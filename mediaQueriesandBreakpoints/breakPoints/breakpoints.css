/*
Breakpoints in CSS are specific pixel values that define where your layout should change to accommodate different screen sizes. They're a key component of responsive web design, allowing you to create websites that look good on all devices, from mobile phones to large desktop monitors.

Here's a brief explanation of how breakpoints work:

You define breakpoints using media queries in your CSS.
At each breakpoint, you can specify different CSS rules to adjust your layout, font sizes, or other styles.
When the screen width matches a breakpoint, the corresponding CSS rules are applied.

/* Default styles for mobile */
body {
    font-size: 16px;
  }
  
  /* Breakpoint for tablets and larger */
  @media (min-width: 768px) {
    body {
      font-size: 18px;
    }
  }
  
  /* Breakpoint for desktops */
  @media (min-width: 1024px) {
    body {
      font-size: 20px;
    }
  }

  What is the difference between media queries and breakpoints?

  Media Queries:

  Are a CSS technique to apply different styles based on various device characteristics.
  Can check for things like screen width, height, orientation, resolution, and more.
  Are the actual CSS code used to implement responsive design.
  Syntax example: @media (min-width: 768px) { ... }

  Breakpoints:

  Are specific values (usually screen widths) at which your layout will change.
  Are the points where you decide to alter your design to better fit the screen size.
  Are a concept or strategy, not a CSS feature themselves.
  Are implemented using media queries in your CSS.

  Breakpoints and media queries are closely related concepts in responsive web design, but they're not exactly the same thing. Here's a breakdown of the differences:

In essence, breakpoints are the strategic points in your design where you want changes to occur, while media queries are the CSS mechanism you use to implement those changes at those breakpoints.
For example, you might decide that your design needs to change at 768px (a breakpoint). You would then use a media query to apply new styles at that breakpoint.
