/*
The z-index property in CSS is used to control the stacking order of elements on a web page. 
It only affects elements that have a position other than static:
(i.e., elements with position: relative, position: absolute, position: fixed, or position: sticky).

How z-index Works:
The z-index value determines the order in which elements are stacked along the z-axis, which is perpendicular to the screen. 
Elements with higher z-index values are stacked on top of elements with lower z-index values.

Values:
auto (default): The stack level of the element is the same as its parent.
integer (positive or negative): The stacking level of the element. Higher values stack above lower values.

.box1{
    position: relative;
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: lightblue;
    z-index: 1;
}

.box2 {
    position: relative;
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: lightgreen;
    margin-top: -50px;
    z-index: 2;
  }

/*
Box 2 will stack on top of box 1 due to the higher z index
