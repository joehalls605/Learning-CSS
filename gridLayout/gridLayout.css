/*
The CSS Grid Layout is a powerful system for creating complex, responsive web layouts. It allows you to define a grid structure with rows and columns, and then place your content within this grid.

Basic Concepts:
Grid Container: The parent element with display: grid;.
Grid Items: The direct children of the grid container, placed within the defined grid structure.
